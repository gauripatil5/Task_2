ChatSpot - Real-Time Chatting Application

Overview:
ChatSpot is a real-time chat application that allows multiple users to connect, send, and receive messages instantly. Built using Socket.IO, Node.js, Express.js, and vanilla JavaScript, this application provides a smooth and interactive chatting experience with a simple yet efficient UI.

Key Features:
âœ… Real-Time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly using WebSockets.
âœ… User Connection Updates: New users joining or leaving are notified to all connected users.
âœ… Minimalistic UI: A clean and responsive user interface for an easy chatting experience.
âœ… Cross-Origin Support: The backend allows secure cross-origin requests, ensuring seamless frontend-backend interaction.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets (Socket.IO)
Deployment: Can be hosted on a local server or deployed on platforms like Heroku or Vercel

How It Works:
User Joins the Chat-
When a user enters their name and joins, their presence is broadcasted to all connected users.

Message Exchange-
Messages are instantly transmitted to other users via Socket.IO, ensuring real-time delivery.

User Leaves-
When a user disconnects, their exit is notified to the chat group.

This project demonstrates the power of real-time web applications using WebSockets and provides a great foundation for further enhancements like authentication, message storage, and multimedia support. ðŸš€
